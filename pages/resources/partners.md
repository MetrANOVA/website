In January 2024, five of the world’s leading research and education (R&E)
networking organizations joined forces to form MetrANOVA, a neutral, trusted,
and open consortium designed to advance network observation, visualization, and
analysis. Together, founding members [Energy Sciences Network (ESnet)](http://www.es.net),
[GÉANT](https://geant.org/), [GlobalNOC at Indiana University](https://globalnoc.iu.edu/),
[Internet2](https://internet2.edu/), and [Texas Advanced Computing Center
(TACC)](https://tacc.utexas.edu/)  operate and connect a dizzying number of
national, regional, and local R&E networks — yet represent only a portion of
the decentralized fabric linkingscientific researchers in hundreds of countries
worldwide.

The R&E networking community can thus be considered a network of networks, the
design and operation of which have historically been loosely coupled yet
coordinated and present some challenges to overcome. MetrANOVA has focused on
three types of deliverables:

  - Developing and sharing open architectures, technical components, design
    patterns, best practices, and policy recommendations to create effective
    network measurement systems.
    - [See list of available tools](/about_explore.html)
  - Educating the R&E community to enable effective use of network measurements
    for operations, engineering, planning, and outreach.
  - Providing growth opportunities for students and staff.

The consortium consists of both Member Organizations and Affiliates (individuals
or organizations) that are actively participating in the project. The set of
individual participants who are contributing to the project are considered
Contributors.
