The MetrANOVA consortium has two types of participants, as detailed on our
[Governance page:](/about_governance.html) 
  - Members: Organizations that contribute an aggregate equivalent of one
    full-time engineer’s (FTE) worth of effort, with at least half of that
    FTE coming from a contributor who is consistently active over the period
    of the engagement, as well as an additional representative who participates
    in the Executive Committee.
  - Affiliates: Organizations or individuals that do not meet the requirements
    for membership but are interested in contributing. Affiliates can
    contribute in more flexible ways, as their resources allow.

MetrANOVA currently needs developers, testers, power users, and individuals who
want to help develop documentation — you name it!
