			     DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{%- endcomment -%}

MetrANOVA is a neutral, trusted, and open consortium for **A**dvancing
**N**etwork **O**bservation, **V**isualization, and **A**nalysis. Its
primary goal is to advance the state of Research and Education
Networking(REN) measurement and analysis by developing and socializing
technical capabilities. Success comes from member organizations and
the broader community using these capabilities publicly and privately
within their infrastructure. To avoid competing against stakeholders'
interests, the consortium will focus on developing tools, tactics, and
techniques but will not offer measurement services. However, Member
Organizations and the broader community are encouraged to use these
tools, tactics, and techniques to create appropriate local,
distributed, and federated solutions.

This consortium will focus on three types of deliverables:

 - Develop and share open architectures, technical components, design
   patterns, best practices, and policy recommendations to create
   effective network measurement systems.

 - Educate the research and education community to enable effective
   use of network measurements for operations, engineering, planning,
   and outreach.

 - Provide growth opportunities for students and staff.

The Consortium will consist of both Member Organizations and
Affiliates (individuals or organizations) that are actively
participating in the project.  The set of individual participants who
are contributing to the project are considered Contributors. A tiered
participation model will allow for different levels of resource
allocation and commitment to the project, enabling a broad base of
Contributors. The final decision-making responsibility for the
projectâ€™s direction resides with an Executive Committee. The Executive
Committee consists of one individual from each of the participating
Member Organizations.
