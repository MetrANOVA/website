Welcome! MetrANOVA offers a suite of open, community-driven tools,
designed to empower Research & Education (R&E) network owners,
operators, engineers, and researchers with advanced measurement,
visualization, and analysis capabilities.

Developed collaboratively by trusted experts, these technical
components, design patterns, and educational resources are designed
to drive innovation in network observability and connect you to a
global network of peers. These tools can be deployed locally or as
part of federated solutions, all without vendor lock-in or commercial
bias.
