In the future, The MetrANOVA consortium will act as a team supporting
those engaged in network measurement and analysis endeavors within the
research and education (R&E) community. As a result of our efforts to
achieve the stated goals below, the following will be true:

 * Networks employ data-driven design and operations to make the most
   of their investment.

 * Engineers have supportable tools, techniques, and tactics to
   execute effectively.

 * A collaboratively developed and sustainable technical ecosystem
   exists that supports a diversity of needs.

 * Large, well-funded, and modest-scale networks can leverage our
   efforts.

 * An ecosystem based on open and loosely coupled architectures
   without dependency on cloud services will exist.
 
 * While encouraging innovation, production-ready building blocks and
   design patterns will facilitate quality services.
 
 * The consortium will leverage expertise from invested organizations
   and individuals to advance the collectiveâ€™s network measurement
   goals more effectively together than apart.


## Goals

MetrANOVA's goals are to:

 * Provide tools, tactics, and techniques to the community.
 
 * Develop and share open architectures, technical components, design
   patterns, best practices, and policy recommendations to create
   effective network measurement systems.
 
 * Facilitate the ability to generate multi-data source composite
   views of R&E cyberinfrastructure.

 * Educate the R&E community to enable effective use of network
   measurements for operations, engineering, planning, and outreach.
 
 * Create learning and growth opportunities for students and staff.
 
 * Coordinate with other community and industry efforts as appropriate

 * Provide technical and policy primitives to support controlled
   sharing.


## Non-Goals

MetrANOVA will not:

 * Develop policy governing the sharing of measurement data by members
   and affiliates.
 
 * Facilitate sharing of data beyond the production of technical and
   policy primitives to support controlled sharing.

 * Create or operate production services or federations of services.
