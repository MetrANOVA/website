While the shared interest in measurement inspired the creation of this
Consortium, success is predicated on a commitment to shared values and
a standard of ethical conduct. What follows is a Code of Conduct we
expect from all individual contributors in the Consortium:

 - Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people.

 - Be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
 
 - Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.

 - Accept responsibility, apologize to those affected by our mistakes,
   and learn from the experience.

 - Focus on what is best, not just for us as individuals but for the
   overall community.
 
 - Engage in succession planning for roles and responsibilities within
   the Consortium.
 
 - Disclose and actively manage conflicts of interest and commitment.
 
 - Don't do anything illegal or immoral.

While incomplete, this sets the standard we should strive for in our
dealings within the Consortium. It is the responsibility of the Member
Organization to ensure their contributors live up to this standard. It
is the Executive Committee's responsibility to remove contributors who
are not living up to the code of conduct.  All forms of participation
in the Consortium is at the discretion of the Executive Committee.
