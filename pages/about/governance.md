The consortium will consist of both member organizations,
affiliates. Individual contributors will come from either a member or
will be an affiliate.  An individual consortium lead will operate the
consortium under the direction from an executive committee.

The governance model is designed to address two objectives that are in
tension. First, the consortium will require a prolonged ongoing
investment of resources to ensure the developed ecosystem is of
sufficient quality and keeps pace with the evolving technical
landscape. Second, the Consortium will take an inclusive approach to
harnessing the collective abilities of the community by encouraging
participation at a smaller scale from organizations and individuals
who may not be able to commit dedicated resources or may have
closely-scoped interests.


## Members

Consortium members are organizations that contribute an aggregate
equivalent of one full-time engineer's worth of effort with at least
0.5 if that coming from a contributor who is consistently active over
the period of the engagement. Contributions may include technical
expertise, training, documentation, or technical leadership. Member
organizations also have a Representative that participates in the
Executive Committee, the contribution to the executive committee is in
addition to the 1 FTE target.

New members are added via a nomination by an executive committee
member followed by a vote of the full executive committee.


## Affiliates

Affiliates are individuals or organizations that do not meet the
requirements for membership but are interested in
contributing. Affiliates are able to contribute in more flexible ways
as their resources allow. This approach enables and recognizes the
value of contributions from non-member institutions. Additionally,
organizations interested in becoming members can first participate as
affiliates where later they are nominated by and voted in via the
executive committee to member status. While affiliates do not have
direct formal representation in the executive committee and therefore
have less input into the project focus and road mapping, it is assumed
that the executive committee will use participatory techniques to
gather feedback from affiliates.

Including new affiliates is based on a nomination from any contributor
and decided by the consortium lead.


## Executive Committee

The executive committee consists of one individual from each member
organization. It meets at least twice a year to review the state of
the consortium and provide higher-level direction. Essential functions
include:

 * Review requests for new members

 * Review conduct of individual contributors and member organizations.
 
 * Ensure roadmaps and strategy exist and are being successfully
   executed.
 
 * Ensure the consortium is providing value to member Organizations.

The decision to add new member organizations is determined by a simple
majority vote by the executive committee. The review of individual
contributor conduct and the decision to remove individuals from the
consortium will require a simple majority vote of the executive
committee.

The review of member organizations might be made based on adherence to
the code of conduct as well as maintaining resource obligations. The
executive committee may vote to remove a member in cases of code of
conduct violation or it may choose to move a member to affiliate
status should that be needed based on ability to maintain
resourcing. In both cases, a majority vote of the executive committee
is required.


## Consortium Lead

The executive committee will appoint a consortium lead that will serve
at the committee's discretion. This individual will represent the
interest of the executive committee and is expected to be sufficiently
technically-engaged to provide leadership and guidance in all aspects
of the consortium. This position will have a two-year duration and
come from one of the member organizations. Back-to-back appointments
are allowed.

Essential duties include:

 * Facilitate and oversee the execution of development and outreach
   efforts.

 * Ensure project work is aligned with stated objectives, strategies,
   and roadmaps.
 
 * Coordinate work assignments and delegation.
 
 * Act as a liaison between the executive committee and the
   contributors.
 
 * Provide periodic status reports as needed by the executive
   committee.
